An implementation of SeeBorg for discord, with random features bolted onto it

Build it w/ visual studio or using msbuild DiscordDSPTestConnect.sln 

Requires the .Net framework to build/run and several configuration files (in the same dir as exe) to run:
  configs.dat:      Holds your bot token. YOU MUST SUPPLY THIS VALUE
  lines.txt:        Chatbot's persistent memory. Will be generated if absent.
  ChannelInfo.tdf:  Borg's channel information. Will be generated if absent.
  whitelist.txt:    Admin list of Discord IDs. Will be generated if absent.
